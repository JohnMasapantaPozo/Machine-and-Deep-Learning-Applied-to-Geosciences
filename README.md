# Machine-and-Deep-Learning-Applied-to-Geosciences
This repository will explore some interesting applications for ML and DL within Geosciences.

The python file called 'Lithology_Prediction_Git' is just a draft of the complete project in wich I explore the ability of some Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques to properly predict lithofacies from well logs. In addition, Some critical parts of the code have been removed since it is a project still in process and the results have not delivered yet. Once the project is completed, the whoole code will be available here.
