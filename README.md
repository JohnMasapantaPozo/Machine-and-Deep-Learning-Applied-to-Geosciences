# Machine-and-Deep-Learning-Applied-to-Geosciences
This repository will explore some interesting applications for ML and DL within Geosciences.

The python file called 'Lithology_Prediction_Git' is just a draft of the complete project. Some critical parts of the code have been removed since it is a project still in process and the results have not delivered yet. Once the project is completed, the complete code will be available here.
